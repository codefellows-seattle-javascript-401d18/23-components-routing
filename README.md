We have been tasked with creating an app that will create Ipsum using Cowsay at the click of a button.

## Using the App
Click the button and generate Ipsum spoken by a poorly rendered cow!
*The app you have been waiting for!*

### Installing the App
Choose a local directory and clone the repository. Install the dependencies with the following command in terminal:
```npm i``` then enter ```npm run watch``` open a browser window and go to ```localhost:8080```
